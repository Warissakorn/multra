Old PROGRESS entries, moved whole, newest first. Nothing here is current: NEXT and ROADMAP
hold status, the decision record holds the reasoning.

## 2026-10-19 — Nodes S0.2: membership (D262, D263)

What a Node holds is now derived from the network inside its polygon ([NODES](../reference/NODES.md) §3, §12).
- **Contract fixed first (D262):** §3 refused any connected Link crossing the boundary twice, which
  refused the shipped T-junction, whose major roads run through as single Links. Legs are now
  boundary crossings: an entry is an in-leg, an exit an out-leg, and a Link's own run through is a
  turn. `NODE_LINK_REENTERS` replaces `NODE_LINK_CROSSES_TWICE`.
- **Model:** `nodeMembership` (`src/model/network/node_membership.*`) gives inside objects, legs,
  turns (checked with `routeLaneChains`), the turn-conflict table and control. Refusals are advisory
  diagnostics at `nodes[i]`, so Run is never blocked.
- **Editor:** the Nodes tab shows control, legs, turns and issues.
- **Rows:** N6–N11 (ctest `nodemembership`); the four-leg gives 4 + 4 legs, 12 turns, signalised;
  the T-junction 3 + 2 legs, 4 turns, unsignalised and 3 conflict rows.
- **Unchanged:** the engine reads no Node; the pin and the TS rows are unchanged. Linux only.
