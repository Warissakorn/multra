## 2026-11-03 — Vistro imports u0-handwritten.csv; timing probe v2

- **Owner:** found Vistro's UTDF menus: *File → Export / Import → Synchro…*. They imported
  `u0-handwritten.csv`.
- **Came through as sheeted:** geometry, speeds, 3.25 m lanes, all four pockets, shared lanes,
  volumes and PHF.
- **Not shown:** the intersection median.
- **Timing refused:** `CellNotFound: Row not found: Row = 3, Column = 1`.
- **Added:** `u0-handwritten-v2-empty.csv` and `-v2-filled.csv`. Their `[Timeplans]` and `[Phases]`
  carry every record Synchro 10.1 writes, in its order; one leaves the unauthored rows empty, the
  other fills them. The import tells whether UT4 ("no unauthored values") survives.
- **Updated:** UTDF_PROBE §4/§6 rows 6 and 13–15, UTDF_EXPORT §3, OWNER_SITTING I.3 and NEXT.
- **Status:** U1 stays blocked. `multra-check-docs` passes.

## 2026-11-03 — U0 golden file moves to Vistro (D438)

- **Owner:** Synchro cannot create UTDF. They asked for another route and chose Vistro as the
  reference (D438).
- **Changed:**
  - UTDF_PROBE §4 now has Vistro steps: draw left-hand and metric, run HCM 7, export `u0-vistro.csv`, find the far-turn column, import the hand-written file, then the licence question.
  - UTDF_PROBE §6: rows 2/4/5/8 are closed as not possible; rows 9–12 are added.
  - UTDF_EXPORT §8, UT0 and UT10, OWNER_SITTING I.1–I.3, `tests/data/utdf/README.md` and NEXT are updated to match.
- **Kept:** Synchro's dialect stays recorded from the real 10.1 export. Synchro only checks the
  import, if it can import UTDF. U1 stays blocked. `multra-check-docs` passes.

## 2026-11-03 — Synchro is right-hand only; left-hand UTDF export modes (D437)

- **Owner answer (U0 item 4):** Synchro builds right-hand traffic only. The upload `2569-P01.csv`
  was an encrypted Synchro 12 project, not UTDF; nothing was read from it or committed.
- **Owner choice (UX-5, D437):** the user picks at export.
  - Geometric (default): real map and legs, far turn in `R`, and the report says the network is left-hand.
  - Mirrored: reflected to right-hand, far turn in `L`, right-hand NEMA numbers.
- **Updated:** UTDF_EXPORT §6/§9/UT11, UTDF_PROBE §6 rows 1 and 7, OWNER_SITTING I.4,
  utdf-real-exports and NEXT.
- **Still open:** the §1 export, both imports of the hand-written file, and whether Links `Lanes`
  counts pockets. U1 stays blocked. `multra-check-docs` passes.

## 2026-11-03 — U0 partly answered from real Synchro/Vistro exports

- **Owner supplied:** UTDF exports and project files from two real studies: Synchro 10.1, Vistro 2026
  (with its `.vistromerge`) and an encrypted Synchro 12.0 `.syn`. None is the UTDF_PROBE §1 junction.
- **Recorded, not committed:** licence and project data are unknown, so only section and field names
  and codes went into [utdf-real-exports](../evidence/utdf-real-exports.md). UTDF_PROBE §6 rows 3/7/8,
  OWNER_SITTING I and NEXT now say what is settled.
- **Findings:**
  - Node TYPE 3 is unsignalised.
  - A phase that ends at the cycle wrap is written `End 0`.
  - `Yield` = End − yellow − all-red.
  - Vistro's dialect adds U/L2/R2 movements, `D1…D32` phases and `Phase1…4`.
  - Vistro has a left-hand setting, but UTDF does not carry it.
- **Still open:** the §1 export, the far-turn column, Synchro's left-hand setting, both imports of
  the hand-written file, and whether Links `Lanes` counts pockets. U1 stays blocked; UTDF_EXPORT
  is unchanged.

## 2026-11-03 — drawing level is not separation (D436, D201 B3)

- **Owner request:** continue NEXT. Every other open line waits on the owner, so this session took the
  booked fix. Owner choice: separation is a confirmed overpass, or Street segments on different levels.
- **Change:** `automaticConflicts` no longer skips path pairs because their drawing `level` differs
  (M3_CONTRACT §1). Pairs of Links generated from an overpass pair or from Street segments on
  different levels stay apart, so Find crossings and D382 keep their meaning. Hand-drawn Links and
  Connectors on different levels now get a passive crossing, as the contract says.
- **Failure first:** the old `levels_apart_do_not_conflict…` became
  `drawing_level_is_not_separation…`; two new rows cover the overpass and level separators. All three
  failed before the fix. Shipped projects have every Link at level 0, so nothing they derive changes.
- **Verification:** release build, `ctest` 272/272, desktop/headless builds and `check`; `multra-check-docs`.
