## 2026-11-13 — M9 A2b: placed and positioned decisions in the loop (D551)

- **D551** (owner: "ทำต่อตามแนะนำ"): contract first (DYNAMIC_ASSIGNMENT §15, MESO_ASSIGNMENT §10), then `routeFamilies` exported from `expandRouteless` into `RunSnapshot`, `decisionFamilyName`, placed (departure) and positioned (`RoutingEvent`) costs in `measureDecisionCosts`, families in the Meso measurement. Group `dynassignplaced` passes DA10–DA13; `mesoassign` passes MA9.
- **Recorded:** the first DA10/DA11 recomputation mapped by departure route and dropped stub left-turners (test fix, values unchanged); MA9's first fixture contradicted §15 (both routes end on one Link) and was amended before re-running (§10.1).
