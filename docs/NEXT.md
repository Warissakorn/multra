# NEXT — what a session does first

The single live to-do, **open items only**: what shipped is in [PROGRESS](PROGRESS.md), the
[archive](archive/README.md) and the [decision record](decisions/RECORD.md); gates are in
[ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md); owner items only in [OWNER_SITTING](plans/OWNER_SITTING.md). Rewrite this file
each session ([AGENTS](../AGENTS.md#session-end)); never append a finished slice here (D319). The
previous full list is [archived](archive/NEXT-state-2026-10-23.md).

## Standing facts

- **Name:** MULTRA (D284, D287); only the file's `"format": "TrafficSim"` stays until a schema step
  reads both. Licence GPL-3.0-or-later (D285); a CLA comes before any outside contribution.
- **Evidence is Linux only** (offscreen Qt 6.4.2); no Windows or high-DPI claim. No session closes a
  milestone gate.
- **Books:** five owner copies (Sheffi, HCM 7, Ortúzar & Willumsen, Planning Handbook 4th ed.,
  Yperman); repositories, page rules, caveats and the chapter map by milestone are in
  [BOOKS](reference/BOOKS.md). Attach with `add_repo`, never vendor; cite the book, read the image
  before using a number. Checks of 2026-10-23: [book-copies-check](evidence/book-copies-check.md).
- **Before an engine slice:** `src/core/` files are at the 500-line limit; split along the
  responsibility a change touches first (D319). The owner deferred splitting `types.hpp` on its
  own: estimated 466 → 420 objects rebuilt after a runtime-state edit, 338 with `eventJson`,
  `checkpointJson` and `summaryJson` moved out of `project/json.hpp`. Do it with the first engine
  slice that edits `Vehicle` or `SimState`, and measure the rebuild before and after.
- **New dialogs** are free functions with their own file (as `behaviour_editor.cpp`), not new
  `EditorWindow` members, and one whose rows can grow uses `dialog_fit` (D318, D319).
- If `map-ui` fails in a parallel `check`, capture its output before re-running.

## Next session — S5.2b, or the owner's pick of an item below

- **S5.2b** ([STUDY_AREA](reference/STUDY_AREA.md) §3, §5; S5.2a is in, D327): the gate-flow OD
  table, reusing the OD table's widget (M8.6b) with gate rows and columns. Until it lands, gate
  flows come only from the file. Also the canvas outline of the area's Nodes. After it:
  - S5.3: Frank–Wolfe path flows and the Macro cut. Measure path storage on the M2.6 template
    first;
  - S5.4: the Meso cut. Cite Yperman's FIFO link model from the owner's copy first;
  - S5.5: side files, SHA-256 stale and the export marking.
- **Other picks:**
  - **OSM (M1.28):** MAP10 still needs the owner's real-study check: align the background,
    trace roads, pan/click without a camera jump, zoom out to the overview, choose a country
    with and without a province, interrupt/restore the connection and retry, then save/reopen.
    Check Windows and the packaged TLS/PROJ dependencies; Linux
    local-server tests do not establish those results. See [MAP_BACKGROUND](reference/MAP_BACKGROUND.md).
- **Lateral, before any shipped behaviour carries its keys**
  ([lateral-run-audit](evidence/lateral-run-audit.md)): on `m2.6-study-template` a changer past its
  window straddles the line and jams both lanes (seed 45: 1908 → 1531 completed; clamps 1 → 33).
  LANE_CHANGE_DURATION §9's reopen condition is met; abandoning a change is the owner's call. The
  switched-on cost (+10–28 % wall) is not worth cutting until then.
- **Meso (M11, in through M11.4b):** the gate needs the benchmark: waiting on the owner's copy of
  Boyles et al. 2025 (D315), then the tolerance and rows. Priority at a Node waits on Brilon and Wu
  (2001) and a cited `t_ij`; HCM 7 Ch. 20's headways are a citable candidate (BOOKS §4). M11.5
  waits on M9, whose two-route fixture has a published candidate (Ortúzar Example 11.1).
- **Macro (S2):** B21, Sheffi Fig 5.1's capacities, for the owner; §19 (b) named runs or (c) a
  procedure sequence are booked (D277).
- **Roads:** demand on a Road-only network (zone connectors attach to Links only) is booked.
- **M3.3.3b**, the W99 contract (ROADMAP M3.3, D177).
- **Clamps:** 5 left on M2.6 (pull-out 1, late catch-up 4), the lane lab's 1 (D252) and source
  clearance (D108); `joinAnticipation` ships off (D255); D95 stays off.
- **Engine spread costs, not booked:** `closestVehicle` 8 %, per-tick `Vehicle` moves 6 % (D283).
- **Owner checks on Windows:** D318's dialogs at 1366×768 or 150 %; E1's tool glyphs and click rule
  (D306); paint, OWNER_SITTING E22. M2.8 has only owner checks left.
